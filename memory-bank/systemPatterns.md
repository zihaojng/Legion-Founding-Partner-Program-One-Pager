This file documents the system architecture, key technical decisions, and design patterns used in the project.

## Key Technical Decisions

-   **UI Component Library**: Adoption of ShadCN as the primary UI component library for building the user interface.
-   **Component Management Workflow**: Integration of MCP tools (Context7, Serper, Fetch MCP) for efficient discovery, extraction, and management of UI components, as detailed in `techContext.md`.
