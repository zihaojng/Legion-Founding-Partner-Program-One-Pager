# ShadCN Context

This file serves as a living log for tracking ShadCN components added to the project.

Each entry should include:
- Component Name
- Source Registry (e.g., default, a custom registry)
- Overrides (any modifications made to the component's code)
- Date Added/Last Updated

This log helps in detecting redundancy and avoiding re-installing components that are already available.
