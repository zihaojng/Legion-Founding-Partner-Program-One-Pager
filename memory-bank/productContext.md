# Product Context: Legion Founding Partner Program One-Pager

This file describes the purpose of the project, the problems it solves, how it should work, and the user experience goals, specifically for the Legion Founding Partner Program One-Pager.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to create a dedicated one-page web resource to inform and recruit potential partners for the Legion Founding Partner Program. It serves as a central point of information to communicate the value proposition of partnering with Legion.

## Problem Solved (by Legion Platform)

Legion addresses the significant time drain experienced by litigators, particularly in small to medium-sized firms, due to the repetitive nature of drafting standard litigation documents like pleadings, discovery requests, and motions. This manual drafting takes away valuable time that could be used for higher-value legal work.

## User Experience Goals (for the One-Pager)

The one-pager should provide a clear, concise, and compelling overview of the Legion platform and the Founding Partner Program. It should effectively communicate the benefits for both potential partners and their clients, leading interested parties to contact Legion for partnership discussions. The design should be professional and easy to navigate, highlighting key information and the call to action (contact email).
